Established in 1996, the Faculty of Computer Science at MSA provides an up-to-date program that satisfies the needs of the local market. Due to the demand for a new generation of high level computer specialists and professionals, the Faculty of Computer Science offers a B.Sc. Degree adopting international standards to fulfil such requirements. The programme design has been informed and guided by the QAA Computing subject benchmarks and the Supreme Council of Egyptian Universities to ensure that the curricula meet the required professional standards of knowledge, cognitive and practical subject specific skills, as well as transferable graduate skills.
There is a balance of practice and theory appropriate to the aims of the programme such that practical activity can be supported by an understanding of underlying principles. The practical application of knowledge develops confidence, reinforces knowledge and prepares students for the different facets of the workplace. The projects taken are designed to develop creativity, critical and reflective thinking and provide an opportunity to demonstrate competence and skills working independently on a practical solution to a given problem. Students at the Faculty of Computer Science are encouraged to develop autonomous learning as well as interpersonal skills to become good communicators, self motivated, aware of their own strengths and weaknesses, with clear vision and plan for their own future. Computer Science offers a focused technical course of study which emphasises software development and computer theory with the goal that students learn how computers are used to solve real-life problems. Students develop excellent programming skills as they build a solid foundation in the theory and practice of computer science and software engineering.
